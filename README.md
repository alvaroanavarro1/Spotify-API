# Spotify-API
Project to learn about working with APIs and Flask.
Please read "requirements.txt" if you want to create and continue developing this API.

To test please log into your Dashboard in [https://developer.spotify.com/](https://developer.spotify.com/), after entering the virtual environment created through the terminal, the user's credentials must be set, obtained through the dashboard. As follows:

```prompt
SET SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
SET SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
SET SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='your-app-redirect-url'
```
After setting the credentials the file "run.py" can be run. 
You must enter the link to the local host in the webbroser, which will automatically open the URI. 
After placing said URI at the prompt, the Home page will be logged.

Below we show images about the app tested at the moment 12/6/2020:
